# Costa's Main Program for Blog

## This project is online at https://costahuang.me/

Some key technologies that are involved in this project:
 *[Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/en-us/designer/) for prototyping some pages and then actually built the page. 
 *[Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/) for the main javascript functionalities
 *[Vue-router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/) for routing pages
 *[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) for code-splitting such that *every blog post* is a basically a Javascript file. 

 If you are interested in reproducing this result, just simply follow the Vue.js npm procedures below:
