    <h1>Welcome</h1>
    <p>Hello strangers, welcome to my personal website. Make yourself comfortable!</p>
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      My name is Costa Huang and I am an undergraduate @ Furman University. 
    
    <h1>Research Intent</h1>
    <p>  
      I am currently applying a Ph.D. position in some universities and I hope to study
      more about RL (Reinforcement Learning).

      Rl studies how to train an agent to react with respect to a given environment. Generally speaking,
      such environment could be arbitrary, and therefore I believe a general and effective RL method 
      could tell us something fundamental about intelligent decisions, or even better, about intelligence.
