    <h1>Hello, </h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my personal website.
      My name is Costa Huang and I am a Computer Science Ph.D student @ Drexel University, in collaboration with my advisor
      <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/santiagoontanonvillar/">Santiago Ontañón</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My primary research now is to use RL (Reinforcement Learning) algorithms to train agents in RTS (Real-time Strategy Games).
      I enjoy AI and web programming, because one could explore and build many fascinating projects
      such as <a href="https://costahuang.me/SC2AI/">training StarCraft II agents to play mini-games</a>,
      <a href="https://vuetifyjs.com/themes/parallax-starter/">building a web design template</a>,
      <a href="https://github.com/streettraffic/streettraffic">collecting and visualizing traffic data</a>,
      and <a href="https://github.com/vwxyzjn/penspider">crawling a site that sells fountain pens</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most skilled languages are Go, Python, and JavaScript/Node.js.
      I use Go for backend API development, Python for general programming tasks such as Data Analysis,
      Web Crawler, Machine Learning, Mathematics, and JavaScript/Node.js for
      web programming by using frameworks such as Vue.js, React.js, Vuetify.js, and etc.

      I frequently use Latex to type Math and CS homeworks. You may find some samples of my work here:
