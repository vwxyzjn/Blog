    <h1>Hello, </h1>
    <p>
      welcome to my personal website.
      My name is Costa Huang and I am an undergraduate @ Furman University.
      I like AI and web programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      My most skilled languages are Python and JavaScript/Node.js.
      I use Python for general programming tasks such as Data Analysis,
      Web Crawler, Machine Learning, Mathematics, and etc, and I use JavaScript/Node.js for
      web programming by using frameworks such as Vue.js, React.js, Vuetify.js, etc
    </p>
    <p>  
      I am currently applying to some universities for a Ph.D. position, hoping to study
      more about RL (Reinforcement Learning), a subject that, in my opinion, will provide insights
      about the general/strong intelligence
    </p>
